--- [...]faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door 2.0 //////// Imminent gloom
-- A touch-based sequencer for crow and landscape.fm's allflesh (and noon), and w//

-- Plug touchplates into the inputs, don't touch them and power you case on so
-- crow can get an idea of where zero is and calibrate them correctly.

-- Time is sett using a W/del linked over the ii bus, the sequences follow
-- the delaytime. Rate currently multiplies the sequence time, but I would like
-- to not be the case and for it to only affect the delaytime.

-- Input 1: Touchpad, valtages here creates the first pattern
-- Input 2: Touchpad, voltages here creates the second pattern

-- Output 1: Touchpad, +5v, add gates to pattern
-- Output 2: Touchpad, -5v, remove gates
-- Output 3: This is where the first sequence of gates emerges
-- Output 4: This is where the second sequcence of gates emgerges
